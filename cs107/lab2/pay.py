A company pays its employees as managers (who receive a fixed weekly salary), hourly workers
(who receive a fixed hourly wage for up to the first 40 hours they work and "time-and-a-half"-
i.e., 1.5 times their hourly wage for overtime hours worked), commission workers (who receive
$250 plus 5.7% of their gross weekly sales), or pieceworkers (who receive a fixed amount of
money for each of the items that they produceâ€“each pieceworker within this company works
on only one item type). Write a program that computes the weekly pay for each employee.
Each type of employee has its own pay code: Managers have paycode 1, hourly workers have
code 2, commission workers have code 3, and pieceworkers have code 4.
