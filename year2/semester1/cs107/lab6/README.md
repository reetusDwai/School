## Purpose: 
Describe what each program does and what problem it solves. You can keep
this brief. Before attempting to program each exercise, include some analysis on how you
think the problem will be solved. Examples include: a flowchart of events in the program,
pseudocode, or a step by step process written in plain english. If you choose to scan your
design please make sure that it is legible. Your README file should contain an analysis
for each exercise.

## Conclusion:
– What you learned during the lab? What new aspect of programming did you learn
from the lab? Be analytical about what you learned.

– Did you encounter any problems? How did you fix those problems?

– What improvements could you make if you had more time to work on this lab?
