# Write a program that prompts the user for a starting value. This starting
# value must be greater than zero. In this event, the prompt will be repeated until a valid number is
# entered. Once a valid starting value has been entered, print out “Proccesing...”, then the number, and
# finally end your program. An interaction will look like this:
# Enter a starting value greater than zero.
# Start: 0
# Start: 17
# Processing...
# 17
